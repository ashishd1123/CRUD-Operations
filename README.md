# CRUD-Operations
The CURD Operations has two main folders. "client" and "server". Each one of those is a stand alone node.js and JavaScript project.

In this project I created CRUD Operation (Create, Read, Update and Delete), User will enter full details and submit the information and it will save in DB.

Now I am using MongoDB in CURD Operation Project and We are implementing backend using the Node.js.
